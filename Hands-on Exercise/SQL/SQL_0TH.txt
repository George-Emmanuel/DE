SQL:
    1. Introduction
        What is SQL?
            SQL - Structured Query Language is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. 
            It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data stored in a database. 
            SQL is widely used in various applications, from web development to data analysis, making it an essential skill for anyone working with data.
        Why learn SQL?
            SQL is a fundamental tool for data management and analysis. 
            It enables you to efficiently query and manipulate large datasets, making it easier to extract insights and make informed decisions. 
            Learning SQL can enhance your career prospects, as it is a highly sought-after skill in many industries, including technology, finance, healthcare, and more.
        What is DBMS?
            DBMS - Database Management System is software that allows users to create, manage, and interact with databases. 
            It provides an interface for users to perform various operations on the data, such as querying, updating, and administering the database. 
            Examples of popular DBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.
        What is Database & Types?
            A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. 
            Databases can be categorized into several types based on their structure and use cases:
                SQL DB:
                    i. Relational Database - Store data in tables with rows and columns (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
                No SQL DB:
                    i. Key-Value Store - Store data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
                    ii. Column Based - Store data in columns for efficient querying (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).
                    iii. Graph Based - Store data in graph structures to represent relationships (e.g., Neo4j). 
                    iv. Document Based - Store data as documents, often in JSON format (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
        Database Structure -
            Server: The physical machine or virtual environment where the database is hosted.
            Database: A collection of related data organized in a structured way.
            Schema: A logical container within a database that holds tables, views, and other database objects.
            Table: A collection of rows and columns that store data in a structured format.
            Row: A single record in a table, representing a specific instance of data.
            Column: A specific attribute or field in a table that holds data of a particular type.
        SQL Commands - 
            Data Definition Language (DDL): Commands used to define and manage database structures (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
            Data Manipulation Language (DML): Commands used to manipulate data within the database (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
            Data Query Language (DQL): Commands used to query and retrieve data from the database (e.g., SELECT).
            Data Control Language (DCL): Commands used to control access to the database (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).
